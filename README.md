# gbk_protocluster_parse
A simple python script for generating a csv-table of protoclusters predicted by antiSMASH. The script takes the annotated .gbk file produced by antiSMASH as input. 

Confused about the difference between a protocluster and a region? See the 
[antiSMASH documentation](https://docs.antismash.secondarymetabolites.org/understanding_output/regions/).
